```

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 18.x or higher
- npm or yarn package manager
- Docker and Docker Compose (for containerized deployment)

## Quick Start

### 1. Local Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start both client and server in development mode
npm run dev
```

### 2. Production Build
```bash
# Build both client and server for production
npm run build
```

### 3. Docker Deployment
```bash
# Build and start containers
docker-compose up --build
```

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Traditional Server Deployment

#### Frontend (Static Files)
The client build creates static files in `client/build/` that can be served by any web server:

```bash
# Serve with Node.js serve package
npm install -g serve
cd client/build
serve -s . -p 3000
```

#### Backend (Node.js Server)
```bash
cd server
npm install --production
npm start
```

### Option 2: Docker Deployment (Recommended)

The application includes Docker configuration for containerized deployment:

```bash
# Production deployment
docker-compose up -d
```

**Services:**
- Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
- Backend: `http://localhost:5555`

### Option 3: Cloud Deployment

#### Frontend Deployment (Static Hosting)
The `client/build/` folder can be deployed to:
- Vercel
- Netlify  
- AWS S3 + CloudFront
- Azure Static Web Apps
- GitHub Pages

#### Backend Deployment (Node.js Hosting)
The server can be deployed to:
- Heroku
- AWS EC2/ECS
- Google Cloud Run
- DigitalOcean App Platform
- Railway

## Environment Configuration

### Client Environment Variables
Create `client/.env`:
```env
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
REACT_APP_ENVIRONMENT=production
```

### Server Environment Variables  
Create `server/.env`:
```env
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=5511
API_URL=http://localhost:5511
```

## Testing

### Run Tests
```bash
# Cypress end-to-end tests
npm run cy:run

# Individual test suites
npm run test
```

### Test Results
- ✅ Home page loads successfully
- ✅ Onboarding page (no tests defined)
- ❌ Use case page (1 failing test - UI element selector needs update)

## Build Warnings
The production build completes successfully but includes linting warnings:
- Unused imports and variables
- Console statements (should be removed for production)
- TypeScript any types (should be properly typed)

**Recommendation**: Address these warnings before final production deployment for code quality.

## Security Considerations
- Remove console.log statements from production code
- Implement proper error handling
- Add rate limiting for API endpoints
- Configure HTTPS in production
- Set up proper CORS policies

## Performance Optimizations
- ✅ Source maps disabled for production build
- ✅ Code splitting enabled
- ✅ Static assets optimized
- 📝 Consider implementing CDN for static assets

## Monitoring and Analytics
- ✅ Google Analytics integration implemented
- ✅ User behavior tracking configured
- 📝 Consider adding error tracking (Sentry, Bugsnag)

## Deep Link Support
- ✅ Confirmd Wallet deep links (confirmdwallet://) implemented
- ✅ QR code generation with deep link support
- ✅ API endpoints for credential offers and proof requests

## Legal Pages
- ✅ Terms and Conditions
- ✅ Privacy Policy  
- ✅ Cookies Policy
- ✅ Careers Page

All legal pages include proper routing, analytics tracking, and navigation.

## Support and Documentation
- See individual README files in client/ and server/ directories
- API documentation available in server/src/
- Component documentation in client/src/components/

## Version Information
- Application Version: 0.1.0

## Troubleshooting

### Docker Networking Issues
If you encounter `NotFoundError` or connection issues when running with Docker:

1. **Ensure services are on the same network**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

2. **Check container connectivity**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec confirmd_frontend ping confirmd_backend
   ```

3. **Verify reverse proxy configuration**:
   The Caddyfile should proxy API requests to `confirmd_backend:5511`

4. **Check environment variables**:
   - Frontend should use `REACT_APP_HOST_BACKEND=""` (empty for relative URLs)
   - Backend should run on port `5511`

### Common Issues
- **404 errors**: Usually indicate routing issues between frontend and backend
- **WebSocket connections**: Ensure both HTTP and WebSocket traffic is properly proxied
- **CORS errors**: Check that the backend CORS configuration allows the frontend domain
