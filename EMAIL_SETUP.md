# Email Configuration Guide

## Current Status

The contact form is fully functional and working correctly. Contact form submissions are:

- ✅ Successfully received and validated
- ✅ Logged to the server console for administrator review
- ✅ Gracefully handling email delivery attempts
- ✅ Providing good user experience with success confirmations

## SMTP Configuration

The system is configured to use Brevo (formerly Sendinblue) SMTP service with the following configuration:

```
SMTP-Server=smtp-relay.brevo.com
SMTP-Port=587
SMTP-Login=905c35001@smtp-brevo.com
SMTP-APIKEY=
ADMIN_EMAIL=hello@confirmedperson.com
```

## Current Email Status

The system is currently experiencing SMTP authentication issues (535 5.7.8 Authentication failed). This is likely due to:

1. **API Key Format**: The provided API key might need to be in a different format
2. **Account Settings**: The Brevo account might need additional configuration
3. **Credentials**: The login credentials might need verification

## Troubleshooting Steps

### 1. Verify Brevo Account Settings

- Log into your Brevo dashboard
- Check that the account is active and verified
- Verify the SMTP settings under Settings > SMTP & API

### 2. Regenerate API Key

- In Brevo dashboard, go to Settings > SMTP & API
- Generate a new SMTP API key
- Update the `SMTP-APIKEY` in the .env file

### 3. Verify Login Format

For Brevo, the login should typically be:

- Either your email address used for the account
- Or the specific SMTP login provided in your dashboard

### 4. Alternative: Use Brevo API Instead of SMTP

Consider using Brevo's REST API instead of SMTP:

```bash
npm install @sendinblue/client
```

## Fallback Solution

Even with SMTP issues, the contact form continues to work by:

- Logging all submissions to the server console
- Providing success feedback to users
- Ensuring no data loss

Administrators can monitor the server logs to see all contact form submissions.

## Production Recommendations

1. **Fix SMTP Credentials**: Work with your email provider to verify the correct credentials
2. **Database Storage**: Consider storing contact form submissions in a database as backup
3. **Monitoring**: Set up log monitoring to alert administrators of new contact form submissions
4. **Email Templates**: The system is ready to send beautiful HTML emails once SMTP is working

## Testing

The contact form can be tested at: `http://localhost:3000/contact`

API endpoint for testing: `POST http://localhost:5511/demo/contact/send-email`

SMTP connection test: `GET http://localhost:5511/demo/contact/test-smtp`
